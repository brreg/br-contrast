## About

This project calculates the ACPA Lc values for Brønnøysundregistrenes color scheme

Allows you to choose a color as text or background, and display the Lc values for each color in the color scheme, and if the calculated Lc value is within the approved limits for Font-Size and Font-Weight


## Modifications

If you want to try this with your own color scheme, you can change the content of `./data/colors.ts` to add the colors you want.

This projects loops through the `brColors` array in `./data/colors.ts`, so make shure the colors you add are added there.

If you want to change the allowed values for APAC Lc, you can do it in `./data/acpaTable.ts`
